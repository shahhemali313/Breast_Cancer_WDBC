# End-to-End Medical Image ML Pipeline

## Overview
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for 
medical image classification, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. 
This project provides a comparative analysis of multiple Machine Learning 
algorithms for classification tasks using statistical evaluation methods.

## Pipeline Stages
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature extraction
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation and visualization
5. Result interpretation
   
## Algorithms Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

## Key Concepts
- Feature selection techniques
- Cross-validation
- Statistical testing of model performance
- Performance metrics comparison
## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow
